	* Added configure.ac from autoscan as move towards 
	the use of autoconf.

	* Removed unused variables from ToyTLM.c found with
	--Wall flags to gcc

	* Added include of malloc.h and function prototype
	for main() to ToyTLM.c

	* Added return(0); as this confirms Paul's experiment
	about removing an error from Make

	* Added a check target to the makefile, a variable for
	rm and - signs in front of commands which may fail
	harmlessly.

	* Created 0.1 tar file and web page for initial release.

	* Added output to the last iteration.

	* Upgraded comments a bit more.

	* Began cleanup from optimized version (which will be a ToyBox
	release) into the Toy flavor which is more clear even from a code
	standpoint.  This code was based off an optimized 3D TLM code so
	most of the generality and optimizations had to be removed in
	order for clarity to reign.  Large amounts of code have been
	removed in order to get to the simple and clear stage.

	* Created ToyTLM and began merging old TLM software into it's
	design style which should map nearly identically to ToyFDTD in
	problem and output.
